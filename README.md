# Sales Campaign and CAGR Project: Excel Dashboard

This project was an Excel-based simulation challenge I completed on Forage for JPMC.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze sales and profit data for different customer accounts over a 5 year period from 2017-2021. I focused on evaluating:

- Sales trends for Small Business, Medium Business, Wholesale Distributor, and Online Retailer accounts
- The impact of different marketing campaigns like social media, coupons, catalog inclusion and posters
- 5 year CAGR growth rates to summarize top performing accounts

## Tools Used

This simulation was entirely done in Excel without access to other reporting or data visualization software. The key functionality I leveraged included:

- Pivot tables and pivot charts to aggregate and visualize data
- Conditional formatting for visual analysis
- Sorting, filtering, formulas like VLOOKUP and SUMIFS
- Chart creation and customization 

## Analysis Highlights

Some of the key insights uncovered through my Excel analysis included:

- Online Retailers drove the highest overall sales figures
- Sales showed steady year-over-year growth from 2017-2021 across accounts
- Combinations of catalog inclusion, coupons, and posters had high correlation with revenue 
- The top 10 accounts by 5YR CAGR were primarily Online Retailers

## Reflection 

This simulation challenged me to tell a compelling data story using only Excel instead of my usual data vis tools. I enjoyed the process of exploring different pivot table perspectives and fine tuning charts to derive insights. In particular, I gained more fluency in techniques like lookups, advanced conditional formatting, and sort logic that are applicable across many BI & analytics tools.
